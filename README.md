# Configure DNSMasq and generate a local SSL certificate for Mac

## Install Homebrew
1. Open Terminal and run the following:

```
mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
```

## Install & Configure DNSMasq
1. Run the following (from https://github.com/wingsuitist/brewamp/blob/master/src/dnsmasq.sh):

```
if (brew services list|grep dnsmasq); then
  tell "DNS Masq guids us to the right IP which is 127.0.0.1 - but it's already here"
else
  tell "DNS Masq guids us to the right IP which is 127.0.0.1 - so lets summon this last deamon"

  brew install -v dnsmasq
  echo 'address=/.dev/127.0.0.1' > $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
  echo 'listen-address=127.0.0.1' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
  echo 'port=35353' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
  brew services start dnsmasq
fi

if [ -e /etc/resolver/dev ]; then
  tell "DNS Masq is already in our resolver list"
else
  tell "So let's call DNS Masq all the time - cause, yes - it's nice"
  sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
  sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/dev'
  sudo bash -c 'echo "port 35353" >> /etc/resolver/dev'
fi
```

## Generate the SSL Certificate
from https://gist.github.com/jed/6147872

1. Open the command line and cd into the root folder of your project.

1. Create a temporary configuration file:

```
cat > openssl.cnf <<-EOF
  [req]
  distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
  x509_extensions = v3_req
  prompt = no
  [req_distinguished_name]
  CN = *.${PWD##*/}.dev
  [v3_req]
  keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
  extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
  subjectAltName = @alt_names
  [alt_names]
  DNS.1 = *.${PWD##*/}.dev
  DNS.2 = ${PWD##*/}.dev
EOF
```

1.  Create the certificate:

```
openssl req \
  -new \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -sha256 \
  -days 3650 \
  -nodes \
  -x509 \
  -keyout ssl.key \
  -out ssl.crt \
  -config openssl.cnf
```

1. if you get the error "unable to write to random state", do

```
sudo rm ~/.rnd
```

and create the certificate again.

1. Remove the configuration file:

```
rm openssl.cnf
```

1. Open the SSL certificate in your keychain:

```
open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app ssl.crt
```

1. Select the newly imported certificate, which should appear at the bottom of the certificate list, right click, and select "Get Info".

1. In the popup window, click the â–¶ button to the left of Trust, and select Always Trust for When using this certificate:.

1. Close the popup window.

1. When prompted, enter your password again and click Update Settings.

1. Close Keychain Access.
